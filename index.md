I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at North Carolina State University in August 2023 under the guidance of Prof. [Arnav Jhala](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/ahjhala).
My focus lies in Visual Narrative Comprehension and Generation, delving into the merging realms of computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, multimedia, and generative AI.

I am currently seeking job opportunities aligned with my research pursuits.
